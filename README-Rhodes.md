To build the Rhodes version (so far, for Android), you need to follow
the [installation instructions](http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhodes/install),
which for the most part on Linux is:

    $ [sudo] gem install rhodes
    $ [sudo] bundle
    $ rhodes-setup

Then, follow the
[Android build instructions](http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhodes/build#build-for-android).
It appears that JDK 1.6 is required and that 1.7 is not supported.
